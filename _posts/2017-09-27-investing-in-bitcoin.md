By now, I’m sure you’ve heard the story: if you had invested just $100 in Bitcoin on January 1st, 2011, it would be worth over $1 million today. By now, you’ve also seen the news articles of 15 year olds striking it rich overnight, of 1000%+ ROIs, and of governments, business leaders, and celebrities diversifying their investments with cryptocurrency. And then, it hits you: FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out.

But you’ve also heard of the inherently volatile nature of the current cryptocurrency market, and the spikes and subsequent crashes. Have you missed the boat? Have all the profits and gains already been taken? Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin and Altcoins?

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Think Long-Term</h2>

Before investing in anything, having confidence in its long-term value is a must. Would you purchase stock in a company with poor leadership, dwindling revenues, lack of innovation, and no sign of improvement? Of course not. In this way, the decision parameters to invest in Bitcoin and Altcoins are much the same. So, what is the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies?

In today’s world, we’ve seen global trade and commerce reach all-time highs. The internet and easy access to connected devices have enabled products and services to be exchanged across continents at a volume never before seen in human history.

Yet amidst this incredible boom in e-commerce, the centuries-old, inefficient system of fiat currency and financial institutions — both backed only by trust — still powers it all.

In an interconnected and global economy, the future lies in decentralized currency. Blockchain technology has the power to increase efficiency, security, and accessibility of computing and transactions at scale. And with that in mind, the long-term viability of cryptocurrency looks promising.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Dollar Cost Averaging</h2>

Buy low, sell high? Easier said than done. In the post-mainstream world of Bitcoin with skyrocketing valuations, it’s easy to believe the get-rich-quick ship has sailed. Well, it has. But that’s okay when thinking *long-term*.

Could this be the height of the market in the short-term? Quite possibly. But considering the real potential for adoption and use at critical mass, Bitcoin has barely scratched the surface.

With this in mind, I believe embracing a disciplined approach for long-term profits is necessary for entry into the cryptocurrency market.

Instead of buying in with a lump sum at today’s valuation, I schedule small, consistent investments each week or month despite its valuation at the time. Whether it’s $25, $50, $100, or $1000, these weekly or monthly investments help to defray the short term losses (and possibly gains). But long-term, the real-world usage of cryptocurrencies will increase, and so will their value.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">Eyes on the Prize</h2>

Keeping a level head in the cryptocurrency market is no easy feat. But keeping up to date with news, while also keeping everything in perspective, can help make blockchain currencies a worthwhile investment.

Ignore the fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and stick to your principles. Zoom out, and watch blockchain adoption increase over time. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay.
